This modified workflow uses a matrix strategy where wordsToReplace is
defined as a list of words (word1, word2, word3). The workflow will run once for each word in the matrix, 
replacing each specified word (word1, word2, word3) with newWord in the file.txt file.

You can adjust the wordsToReplace matrix to include the words you want to replace in your file. 
This setup enables the workflow to iterate through each word in the matrix and perform 
the replacement actions specified in the steps.
