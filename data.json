In the activity selection problem (Explained below), if more activities can be done before finishing the current activity, these activities can be performed within the same time.  Another reason is to divide a problem recursively based on a condition, with no need to combine all the solutions. In the activity selection problem, the \u201crecursive division\u201d step is achieved by scanning a list of items only once and considering certain activities.",

The first set contains the vertices already included in the MST, the other set contains the vertices not yet included.

After picking the edge, it moves the other endpoint of the edge to the set containing MST. ",

Generally, Python only uses only one thread to execute the set of written statements. The performance of the single-threaded process and the multi-threaded process will be the same in Python and this is because of GIL in Python. We can not achieve multithreading in Python because we have a global interpreter lock that restricts the threads and works as a single thread.",

However, the performance of a binary search tree is highly dependent on its shape, and in the worst case, it can degenerate into a linear structure with a time complexity of O(n). This is where Red Black Trees come in, they are a type of balanced binary search tree that use a specific set of rules to ensure that the tree is always balanced. This balance guarantees that the time complexity for operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching is always O(log n), regardless of the initial shape of the tree.",

The drawback of the B-tree used for indexing, however, is that it stores the data pointer (a pointer to the disk file block containing the key value), corresponding to a particular key value, along with that key value in the node of a B-tree. This technique greatly reduces the number of entries that can be packed into a node of a B-tree, thereby contributing to the increase in the number of levels in the B-tree, hence increasing the search time of a record. B+ tree eliminates the above drawback by storing data pointers only at the leaf nodes of the tree. Thus, the structure of the leaf nodes of a B+ tree is quite different from the structure of the internal nodes of the B tree. It may be noted here that, since data pointers are present only at the leaf nodes, the leaf nodes must necessarily store all the key values along with their corresponding data pointers to the disk file block, in order to access them. ",

The leaf nodes, therefore form the first level of the index, with the internal nodes forming the other levels of a multilevel index. Some of the key values of the leaf nodes also appear in the internal nodes, to simply act as a medium to control the searching of a record. From the above discussion, it is apparent that a B+ tree, unlike a B-tree, has two orders, \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019, one for the internal nodes and the other for the external (or leaf) nodes. ",

            "A code that is written to aimed to get the services of the managed runtime environment execution like CLR(Common Language Runtime) in .NET Framework is known as Managed Code. It is always implemented by the managed runtime environment instead of directly executed by the operating system. The managed runtime environment provides different types of services like garbage collection, type checking, exception handling, bounds checking, etc. to code automatically without the interference of the programmer. It also provides memory allocation, type safety, etc to the code. The application is written in the languages like Java, C#, VB.Net, etc. is always aimed at runtime environment services to manage the execution, and the code written in these types of languages is known as managed code.",
            "A code that is directly executed by the operating system is known as Unmanaged code. It is always aimed at the processor architecture and depends upon computer architecture. When this code is compiled it always tends to get a specific architecture and always runs on that platform, in other words, whenever you want to execute the same code for the different architecture you have to recompile that code again according to that architecture. It always compiles to the native code that is specific to the architecture. To read more, refer to the article: Managed and Unmanaged code ",
            "12. What is the difference between a struct and a class in C#? ",
            "A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Basically, a class combines the fields and methods(member function which defines actions) into a single unit.",
            "A structure is a collection of variables of different data types under a single unit. It is almost similar to a class because both are user-defined data types and both hold a bunch of different data types. To read more, refer to the article: struct and class in C#",
            "13. What is enum in C#? ",
            "Enumeration (or enum) is a value data type in C#. It is mainly used to assign the names or string values to integral constants, which make a program easy to read and maintain. For example, the 4 suits in a deck of playing cards may be 4 enumerators named Club, Diamond, Heart, and Spade, belonging to an enumerated type named Suit. Other examples include natural enumerated types (like the planets, days of the week, colors, directions, etc.). The main objective of enum is to define our own data types(Enumerated Data Types). Enumeration is declared using the enum keyword directly inside a namespace, class, or structure. To read more, refer to the article: Enum in C#",
            "14. What is the difference between ref and out keywords?",
            "The ref is a keyword in C# which is used for passing the arguments by a reference. Or we can say that if any changes made in this argument in the method will reflect in that variable when the control return to the calling method. The ref parameter does not pass the property.",
            "The out is a keyword in C# which is used for passing the arguments to methods as a reference type. It is generally used when a method returns multiple values. The out parameter does not pass the property. To read more, refer to the article: ref and out keywords",
            "15. What is Boxing and Unboxing in C#?",
            "Boxing and unboxing is an important concept in C#. C# Type System contains three data types: Value Types (int, char, etc), Reference Types (object), and Pointer Types. Basically, it converts a Value Type to a Reference Type, and vice versa. Boxing and Unboxing enable a unified view of the type system in which a value of any type can be treated as an object.",

            "To read more, refer to the article: C# \u2013 Boxing and Unboxing",
            "16. What are Properties in C#?",
            "Properties are the special type of class members that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. Properties can be used as if they are public data members, but they are actually special methods called accessors.

            "It recognizes and checks the methods, or properties during compile time. In this binding, the compiler already knows about what kind of object it is and what are the methods or properties it holds, here the objects are static objects. The performance of early binding is fast and it is easy to code. It decreases the number of run-time errors.",
            "In late binding, the compiler does not know about what kind of object it is and what are the methods or properties it holds, here the objects are dynamic objects. The type of the object is decided on the basis of the data it holds on the right-hand side during run-time. Basically, late binding is achieved by using virtual methods. The performance of late binding is slower than early binding because it requires lookups at run-time. To read more, refer to the article: Early binding and Late Binding",
            "19. What are the different ways in which a method can be Overloaded in C#?",
            "Method Overloading is the common way of implementing polymorphism. It is the ability to redefine a function in more than one form. A user can implement function overloading by defining two or more functions in a class sharing the same name. C# can distinguish the methods with different method signatures. i.e. the methods can have the same name but with different parameters list (i.e. the number of the parameters, order of the parameters, and data types of the parameters) within the same class.",

The value of the constant field is the same throughout the program or in other words, once the constant field is assigned the value of this field is not be changed. In C#, constant fields and locals are not variables, a constant is a number, string, null reference, boolean values. readonly keyword is used to declare a readonly variable. This readonly keyword shows that you can assign the variable only when you declare a variable or in a constructor of the same class in which it is declared. To read more, refer to the article: constant and read-only in C# 22. Can multiple catch blocks be executed?",
            "The main purpose of the catch block is to handle the exception raised in the try block. This block is only going to execute when the exception is raised in the program. In C#, You can use more than one catch block with the try block. Generally, multiple catch block is used to handle different types of exceptions means each catch block is used to handle different type of exception. If you use multiple catch blocks for the same type of exception, then it will give you a compile-time error because C# does not allow you to use multiple catch block for the same type of exception. A catch block is always preceded by the try block.",
            "In general, the catch block is checked within the order in which they have occurred in the program. If the given type of exception is matched with the first catch block, then the first catch block executes and the remaining of the catch blocks are ignored. And if the starting catch block is not suitable for the exception type, then the compiler searches for the next catch block. To read more, refer to the article: Multiple catch block in C#",

            "24. What is the  System. String and System.Text.StringBuilder classes?",
            "C# StringBuilder is similar to Java StringBuilder. A String object is immutable, i.e. a String cannot be changed once created. Every time when you use any of the methods of the System. String class, then you create a new string object in memory. For example, a string \u201cGeeksForGeeks\u201d occupies memory in the heap, now, changing the initial string \u201cGeeksForGeeks\u201d to \u201cGFG\u201d will create a new string object on the memory heap instead of modifying the initial string at the same memory location. In situations where you need to perform repeated modifications to a string, we need the StringBuilder class. To avoid string replacing, appending, removing, or inserting new strings in the initial string C# introduce StringBuilder concept. StringBuilder is a dynamic object. It doesn\u2019t create a new object in the memory but dynamically expands the needed memory to accommodate the modified or new string. To read more, refer to the article: System.String and System.Text.StringBuilder in C#",

            "The System.Array.CopyTo() technique makes a replica of the components into another existing array. It makes copies the components of one cluster to another existing array. The Clone() technique returns a new array object containing every one of the components in the first array. The Clone() makes a duplicate of an array as an object, consequently should be cast to the real exhibit type before it tends to be utilized to do definitely. The clone is of a similar type as the first Array.  ",

            "The primary difference between dispose() and finalize() is that the dispose() must be explicitly invoked by the user and the finalize() is called by the garbage collector when the object is destroyed.",
            "27. What are delegates in C#?",
            "A delegate is an object which refers to a method, or you can say it is a reference type variable that can hold a reference to the methods. Delegates in C# are similar to the function pointer in C/C++. It provides a way that tells which method is to be called when an event is triggered. For example, if you click a button on a form (Windows Form application), the program would call a specific method. In simple words, it is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type and then calls the method in a program for execution when it is needed. To read more, refer to the article: Delegates in C# ",

            "We can call an overloaded constructor from another constructor using this keyword but the constructor must belong to the same class because this keyword is pointing to the members of the same class in which this is used. This type of calling the overloaded constructor is also termed as Constructor Chaining. To read more, refer to the article: Constructor Chaining 30. What is a multicasting delegate in C#?",
            "Multicasting of delegate is an extension of the normal delegate(sometimes termed as Single Cast Delegate). It helps the user to point more than one method in a single call.",
            "31. What are Generics in C#?",
            "Generic is a class that allows the user to define classes and methods with the placeholder. Generics were added to version 2.0 of the C# language. The basic idea behind using Generic is to allow type (Integer, String, \u2026 etc, and user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces. A primary limitation of collections is the absence of effective type checking. This means that you can put any object in a collection because all classes in the C# programming language extend from the object base class. This compromises type safety and contradicts the basic definition of C# as a type-safe language. In addition, using collections involves a significant performance overhead in the form of implicit and explicit type casting that is required to add or retrieve objects from a collection. To read more, refer to the article: Generics in C#  32. Describe Accessibility Modifiers in C#?",
            "Access Modifiers are keywords that define the accessibility of a member, class, or datatype in a program. These are mainly used to restrict unwanted data manipulation by external programs or classes. There are 4 access modifiers (public, protected, internal, private) which defines the 6 accessibility levels as follows:",
            "33. What is a Virtual Method in C#?",
            "In C# virtual method is a strategy that can be reclassified in derived classes. We can implement the virtual method in the base class and derived class. It is utilized when a method\u2019s fundamental work is similar but in some cases derived class needed additional functionalities. A virtual method is declared in the parent class that can be overridden in the child class. We make a virtual method in the base class by using the virtual keyword and that method is overridden in the derived class using the Override keyword.  It is not necessary for every derived class to inherit a virtual method, but a virtual method must be created in the base class. Hence the virtual method is also known as Polymorphism. To read more, refer to the article: Virtual Method in C#",

            "Multi-threading is a process that contains multiple threads within a single process. Here each thread performs different activities. For example, we have a class and this call contains two different methods, now using multithreading each method is executed by a separate thread. So the major advantage of multithreading is it works simultaneously, which means multiple tasks execute at the same time. And also maximizing the utilization of the CPU because multithreading works on time-sharing concept mean each thread takes its own time for execution and does not affect the execution of another thread, this time interval is given by the operating system.

The Hashtable class provides various types of methods that are used to perform different types of operations on the hashtables. In Hashtable, keys are used to access the elements present in the collection. For very large Hashtable objects, you can increase the maximum capacity to 2 billion elements on a 64-bit system.",

            "LINQ is known as Language Integrated Query and it is introduced in .NET 3.5 and Visual Studio 2008. The beauty of LINQ is it provides the ability to .NET languages(like C#, VB.NET, etc.) to generate queries to retrieve data from the data source. For example, a program may get information from the student records or accessing employee records, etc. In, past years, such type of data is stored in a separate database from the application, and you need to learn different types of query language to access such type of data like SQL, XML, etc. And also you cannot create a query using C# language or any other .NET language.",
            "To overcome such types of problems Microsoft developed LINQ. It attaches one, more power to the C# or .NET languages to generate a query for any LINQ compatible data source. And the best part is the syntax used to create a query is the same no matter which type of data source is used means the syntax of creating query data in a relational database is the same as that used to create query data stored in an array there is no need to use SQL or any other non-.NET language mechanism. You can also use LINQ with SQL, with XML files, with ADO.NET, with web services, and with any other database. To read more, refer to the article: LINQ in C#",

            "Generally, the file is used to store the data. The term File Handling refers to the various operations like creating the file, reading from the file, writing to the file, appending the file, etc. There are two basic operations that are mostly used in file handling is reading and writing of the file. The file becomes stream when we open the file for writing and reading. A stream is a sequence of bytes that is used for communication. Two streams can be formed from the file one is the input stream which is used to read the file and another is the output stream is used to write in the file. In C#, the System.IO namespace contains classes that handle input and output streams and provide information about file and directory structure.",

It is because the CPU is responsible for query operation whereas our data is stored in hard disk(secondary memory). Now CPU is computing a million input per second (MIPS) whereas our hard disk is only doing <100 operations per second no matter how fast it be. So they cannot interact with each other directly but have to correspond to which we bring primary memory (RAM) into play which can operate faster via caching but it is not optimized as perceived from the below media:",

            "The data is fetched from secondary memory in blocks as studied in OS. Note here data can be structured or non-structured. At the backend, the storage manager in OS does the job by putting all the data from logical drives into secondary memory in multiple chunks of blocks known as sectors. Now, these blocks are fetched into main memory(RAM) where we are not focusing on reducing the block size or changing it.",
            "Here in indexing when a single block is inserted in RAM at once and retrieval of data occurs. If the answer to the desired query is fetched then it is called \u2018cache-hit\u2019 else it is known as \u2018cache=miss\u2019. ",
            "Tip: There is a cost associated with this cache hit-miss operation known as I/O cost. ",
            "In this way instead of rolling the complete data into RAM which takes an enormous amount of time as a cost in designing the model, with indexing the same data can be fetched just likely what we have had in books. ",

            "Now if we do not apply to index we have to put the whole record from the organization directory to RAM for just a basic query while with help of indexing no matter how big the organization scales up cache hit-and-miss operations drastically reduce the cost not only for this query but even to complex ones as there will be only hit or miss operation. If fetched, hit else cache-miss. ",

            "Indexing in a Table In a Database",
            "Note: Indexing and hashing in a database are very important from an interview perspective as it is been asked in many system design interview.",
            "Indexing has several benefits, including",
            "Now after having an understanding of the concept of indexing let us adhere forward to the concept of partitioning.",
            "It is a database procedure of partitioning that involves breaking up a very large table into a number of smaller sections. Queries that access only a tiny portion of the data can run faster since there is fewer data to scan when huge tables are divided into smaller individual tables. When the amount of data is large and a single system cannot handle it, partitioning is used.",
            "Now let us discuss different methods of achieving partitioning that is as follows:",
            "There are 3 types of partitioning that are listed below and later discussed as follows: ",
            "Let us discuss them in detail for better understanding as follows:",
            "1. Horizontal Partitioning: Without the need to make separate tables for each portion, horizontal partitioning divides big tables into smaller, more manageable pieces. A partitioned table\u2019s data is physically kept in row groups known as partitions. It is possible to access and save each partition independently. In horizontal partitioning, each shard has the same schema as the parent database.",
            "Application: Zipcode ",
            "Note: It is also known as shading or sometimes referred as range-based partitioning.",
            "2. Vertical Partitioning: Tables with fewer columns are created using the vertical partitioning technique, and the remaining columns are stored in new tables. Data is presented in a vertical format.",
            "The main purpose of vertical table partitioning is to increase SQL Server speed, particularly when a query needs to fetch all columns from a database with a lot of text or BLOB columns.",
            "Application: Large Reports(be it of any domain) ",
            "3. Directory-based Partitioning: A search function that is aware of the partitioning structure and decouples it from the database access code. It enables modifying the partitioning scheme or adding new database servers without impacting the application. It results in a horizontally scalable application that is loosely connected. Since key-based partitioning requires the use of a hash function that cannot be often updated.",
            "However, since directory-based partitioning is a more dynamic method and is therefore more flexible, we can use any technique to assign data to the shards.",
            "Now geeks you must be wondering what is the criteria behind above discussed methods of partitioning. So let us do discuss them now to get grasp understanding over concept of partitioning that is as follows:",
            "Sharding is a very important concept that helps the system to keep data in different resources according to the sharding process. The word \u201cShard\u201d means \u201ca small part of a whole\u201c.  Sharding means dividing a larger part into smaller parts. In DBMS, Sharding is a type of database partitioning in which a large Database is divided or partitioned into smaller data and different nodes. These shards are not only smaller, but also faster and hence easily manageable. ",
            "Illustration: Now let us consider two scenarios where there is no sharding and in other, we will be having simple sharding via medias to understand it better as follows:",
            "No sharding",
            "Simple Sharding",
            "Consider a very large database whose sharding has not been done. For example, let\u2019s take a Database of a college in which all the student records (present and past) in the whole college are maintained in a single database. So, it would contain a very large number of data, say 100, 000 records. Now when we need to find a student from this Database, each time around 100, 000 transactions have to be done to find the student, which is very very costly. ",
            "Sharding Of A Database",
            "Now consider the same college students\u2019 records, divided into smaller data shards based on years. Now each data shard will have around 1000-5000 students\u2019 records only. So not only the database became much more manageable, but also the transaction cost each time also reduces by a huge factor, which is achieved by Sharding. Hence this is why Sharding is needed."

            "In a client-server architecture, we are sending a request to server and server sends it back and so in this way communication takes place. But in designing the system biggest problem we face is whether we can implement the client-server model because we can not wait until the server responds. Here Web Sockets play a crucial role that solving problems and enabling us to have real-time communication. They are more or less used in every system to be designed because we can not let our system wait for a response. Consider an example of text messaging services occurring in real-time to stay connected popularly such as Slack and Whatsapp.",

            "In short polling, the client sends a request to the server and the server immediately sends data at fixed intervals whether the data is updated or not. In long polling, the server waits for the client\u2019s request to respond and responds only and only if some new data is available or if some data is being updated. Now again in long polling client sends the request and the server waits if no new information is available or the data is not being got updated, the server will wait and not be allowed to respond.",

This topic provides you with the details to filter and sort the results of API requests and also guides you to handling the pagination of large result sets returned from an API request.",
            "Note: Sorting and filtering are supported for substrings. For example, if you want to search for bots or files that have fin in their names, enter fin as the search criterion. All the bots and files that contain fin in the names will be displayed, for example, Finance, Finder, DeltaFinance, and Dolfin.Wildcards are not supported for searching and filtering bots or files.",

            "The requirement of a database in Android is fulfilled by SQLite from the very beginning. However, it comes with some severe drawbacks like not checking the queries at compile-time, it does not save plain-old-Java Objects(commonly referred to as POJOs). Developers also need to write a lot of boilerplate code to make the SQLite database work in the Android OS environment. The Room component comes into the picture as an SQLite Object Mapping Library which overcomes all the mentioned challenges. Room converts queries directly into objects, checks errors in queries at the compile-time, and is also capable of persisting the Java POJOs. ",

            "Route poisoning is a way to control a router from transmitting packets through a path that has become weak within computer networks. Distance-vector routing protocols in computer networks use route poisoning to show other routers that a route is no longer reachable and should not be considered from their routing tables. The split horizon with poison reverses the route poisoning and delivers updates with unreachable hop counts directly to all the nodes in the network. When the protocol catches an invalid route, all of the routers in the network are notified that the bad route has an infinite (∞) route metric. This makes all nodes on the invalid route seem infinitely distant, stopping any of the routers from sending packets over the invalid path.",

            "33. What is Split Horizon Cisco?",
            "A split horizon is developed to stop routing loops. Routing loops happen when a loop is created between two or more routers. For example, Router 1 has a network path to 192.168.1.0 via Router 2. Router 2 has a path to the same network, but it is back via Router 1. Therefore, Router 1 sends packets for 192.168.1.0 to Router 2, which then transmits the packets back to Router 1. This looping continues until the TTL (Time to Live) on the packet expires.",
            "For more details please refer to the  Route Poisoning and Count to infinity problem in the Routing article.",
            "34. Why is RIP known as Distance Vector?",
            "The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is the oldest distance-vector routing protocol that uses the hop count as a routing metric. RIP stops routing loops by executing a limit on the number of hops authorized in a path from source to destination. The largest number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP can support. RIP executes the split horizon, route poisoning, and hold-down means to prevent the wrong routing information from being propagated. In RIPv1 routers broadcast updates with their routing table every 30 seconds. In the early deployments, routing tables were short enough that the traffic was not important. As networks grew in size, however, it became obvious there could be a huge traffic burst every 30 seconds, even if the routers had been initialized at random times. ",
            "For more details please refer to the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) article.",
            "35. What is the administrative distance of RIP?",
            "By default, OSPF has a default management level of 110 and RIP has a default management level of 120.",
            "For more details please refer to the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) article.",
            "36. What is the limit of hop count in RIP?",
            "The limit of hop count in RIP is 15. Networks with a hop count of 16 or more are unreachable.",
            "For more details please refer to the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) article.",
            "37. How is RIP select the best path to the remote network?",
            "The main function of the router is to determine the best way to send the packets. To determine the best route, a router searches its router table to find a network address similar to the destination IP address of the package.",
            "For more details please refer to the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) article.",
            "38. What are the differences between RIPv1 and RIPv2?",
            "RIPv1 uses a standard route. Occasional updates do not have subnet information and no support for VLSM. This limitation makes it impossible to have subnets of different sizes within the same network category. In other words, all subnets in the network class should be the same size. There is also no router authentication support, which makes RIP vulnerable to various attacks. RIPv2 is a vector distance route protocol defined in RFC 1723. As a phaseless protocol, it means, it included a subnet mask and network addresses in its router updates.",
            "For more details please refer to the Differences between RIPv1 and RIPv2 article.",
            "39. What is pinhole congestion?",
            "In computer networking, the router makes decisions regarding the way a packet will travel, based on the number of hops it carries to reach the destination and if it had 2 other ways to get there, it will only send it via the shortest path, regardless of the connection speed. This is known as pinhole congestion.",
            "For more details please refer to the Congestion Control in Computer Networks article.",
            "40. What is a passive interface in RIP?",
            "Router (config-router) # passive-interface serial0 / 0/0. Sets the interface as idle, meaning that route updates will not be sent to this interface. NOTE: In RIP, the passive-interface command will prevent the inter-face from sending route updates but will allow the visual interface to receive updates.",
            "For more details please refer to the Passive-Interface Command Behavior in RIP, EIGRP & OSPF article.",
            "41. Explain the loop avoidance mechanism in RIP.",
            "The following methods are used to avoid Routing Loops in RIP:",
            "For more details please refer to the  Routing Loop and How to Avoid Routing Loop article.",
            "42. Why EIGRP is called hybrid protocol?",
            "EIGRP does not transfer all data to the Routing table when changes are made, but will only transfer changes made since the Routing table was last updated. EIGRP does not send its routing table periodically, but will only send routing data in the event of a real change. This behavior is highly compliant with link-state routing regulations, so EIGRP is considered a hybrid protocol.",
            "For more details please refer to the EIGRP fundamentals article.",
            "43.  What is meant by active and passive states in EIGRP?",
            "For more details please refer to the EIGRP fundamentals article.",
            "44. What does stuck-in-active mean?",
            "EIGRP is a reliable protocol and for each question the route you send to its neighbors you must get a response within 3 minutes. If the router does not get an answer to ALL its pending questions it will set the stage for SIA (STUCK INACTIVE) and kill the nearest neighbor.",
            "45.  What is the EIGRP Feasibility Condition?",
            "The Feasibility condition states that the route will not be accepted if the Reported Range exceeds the best possible Route range. Or it means another way from a router\u2019s point of view: the path to the network will not be accepted if my neighbor\u2019s cost exceeds my cost. ",
            "For more details please refer to the EIGRP Cost Calculation article.",
            "46. Explain what will happen if the packet is not acknowledged?",
            "If a packet is not acknowledged by the network, it means that the data was successfully delivered to its destination but no response was received from either end. As long as both ends are aware of each other and have been configured correctly, there should be no reason for the receiving node to do anything further with this packet. Data may still be flowing through this connection because acknowledgments take the time or because some intermediate nodes might be buffering packets before forwarding them on. However, if at any point in time you notice your traffic slowing down noticeably or becoming completely unavailable due to an excessive number of lost packets (especially during high-traffic times), then it\u2019s likely that something has gone wrong and you\u2019ll need to investigate what caused it.",
            "For more details please refer to the Stop and Wait for protocol, and its problems, and solutions article.",
            "47. Explain Null Zero in EIGRP?",
            "It is a visual interface used to ensure that routes enter the RIB, the tracks must have the next-hop to get into the RIB. If a packet arrives on a device with a route to Null 0 and is not elsewhere, it will dispose of it as the ACL would. Think of it as a visible interaction when the packets die well.",
            "For more details please refer to the article EIGRP fundamentals ",
            "48.  What is the EIGRP stub routing feature?",
            "The EIGRP stub routing feature allows the network administrator to prevent queries from being sent to a remote device. In addition to a simple hub and spoke network, where the remote device is connected to a single distribution device, the remote device can have a dual home on two or more distribution devices.",
            "49. Difference between LSA & LSU in OSPF?",
            "Link State Update (LSU) packs are OSPF Type 4. packs. Each LSA contains route, metrics, and topology information to define part of the OSPF network. The local router advertises the LSA inside the LSU package to its neighbors.",
            "50.  What is Route Redistribution in computer networks?",
            "The use of a routing protocol to broadcast routes that are known by some other means, such as by another routing protocol, static routes, or directly connected routes, is called redistribution. While operating a single routing protocol throughout your whole IP internetwork is desirable, multi-protocol routing is common for a number of reasons, such as enterprise unions, multiple departments controlled by multiple network administrators, and multi-vendor environments. Running other routing protocols is usually part of a network design. In any case, having a multiple protocol environment makes redistribution a need.",

It is used to build applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, and the web. Flutter uses the Dart programming language. It provides a simple, powerful, efficient, and easy-to-understand SDK, and It is the most used framework in top companies such as Google Ads, eBay, Tencent, BMW app, and Google Pay because of its performance and dependencies. ",

            "Flutter is a mobile application development framework that allows developers to create high-performance, beautiful, and responsive mobile applications for multiple platforms using a single codebase. It is different from other mobile app development frameworks because of the following reasons:",
            "Dart is a client-side programming language that is used in Flutter for developing mobile applications. Dart is used in Flutter because of the following reasons:",
            "In Flutter, widgets are the building blocks for creating UI elements. There are two types of widgets in Flutter:",
            "In Flutter, StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget are two different types of widgets that are used to create UI elements.",
            "In Flutter, a Key is an object that identifies a widget. It is used to maintain the state of the widget and to optimize the rendering performance of the app.",
            "When a widget is built, Flutter assigns a unique identity to it based on its location in the widget tree. However, when the widget tree is modified, such as when a widget is added, removed, or moved, the identity of the widgets can change. This can cause unexpected behavior and can lead to performance issues.",
            "To solve this problem, Flutter provides the Key class, which can be used to assign a unique identity to a widget that persists even if the widget tree is modified. Keys can be used to match widgets across different builds of the widget tree, ensuring that the state of the widget is preserved correctly.",
            "There are two main types of keys in Flutter:",

            "Navigator and Router are two different ways of navigating between screens in a Flutter application.",
            "Navigator is a widget that is used to manage the navigation stack of an application. It allows users to navigate back and forth between screens in the app using the back button or gestures. Navigator provides a simple and easy-to-use way of managing the navigation stack, but it has some limitations when it comes to customizing the transition animations and handling complex navigation flows.",
            "Router, on the other hand, is a more flexible and powerful way of managing the navigation stack in a Flutter application. It allows developers to customize the transition animations, handle complex navigation flows, and pass data between screens more easily. However, using a router requires more code and setup than using the built-in Navigator widget.",
            "In Flutter, state refers to the data or information that can change dynamically during the lifetime of a widget. Widgets are the building blocks of a Flutter app, and they can be either stateful or stateless.",
            "Stateful widgets maintain state information and can update their state when required. The state is managed by a separate object known as a State object. The state object is created when a stateful widget is inserted into the widget tree and is destroyed when the widget is removed from the tree.",
            "setState() is a method that is used to update the state of a Stateful widget in Flutter. When a widget is updated, the Flutter framework calls the build() method of the widget to rebuild its UI based on the new state.",
            "The setState() method is used to tell the Flutter framework that the state of the widget has changed and that it needs to rebuild the UI. The setState() method takes a function as an argument, which updates the state of the widget. Once the state is updated, the build() method is called again, and the UI is rebuilt.",
            "StatelessWidget is more performant than StatefulWidget because it does not have any mutable state. Once a StatelessWidget is built, its properties cannot be changed, and the Flutter framework does not need to track its state.",
            "StatefulWidget, on the other hand, is less performant than StatelessWidget because it has a mutable state. The Flutter framework needs to track the state of a StatefulWidget and rebuild its UI every time the state changes.",
            "However, the performance difference between StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget is usually negligible for most applications, and developers should choose the widget type based on their needs.",
            "The MaterialApp widget is used to create a Material Design application in Flutter. It provides pre-built widgets that follow the Material Design specifications, such as AppBar, BottomNavigationBar, and FloatingActionButton.",
            "The MaterialApp widget also provides some important features, such as theme customization, internationalization support, and routing. It is the most commonly used widget for creating mobile applications in Flutter.",

The Scaffold widget also provides some important features, such as drawer support, floating action button support, and Snackbar support. It is the most commonly used widget for creating the basic structure of a Material Design application in Flutter.",
            "The BuildContext parameter is used to access the widget tree and perform actions such as building or updating widgets. The BuildContext object represents the location of a widget in the widget tree. It provides access to the nearest BuildContext ancestor, which can be used to access the properties of the ancestor widget or its children. The BuildContext parameter is required in the build() method of a widget because it is used to build the UI of the widget and its children.",
            "In Flutter, push and pushReplacement are two methods that are used to navigate between different screens in an app. Both methods are available on the Navigator class, which manages the navigation stack in a Flutter app.",

            "The Widget Inspector provides information about the properties and state of each widget in the tree. It also allows developers to modify the properties and state of widgets in real-time, which can be useful for debugging UI issues.

            "The Expanded widget is used to expand a child widget to fill the available space within a parent widget. The Expanded widget is commonly used in a Row or Column widget to evenly distribute space among its children. For example, if a Row widget has three child widgets, and one of the child widgets is wrapped in an Expanded widget, that child widget will expand to fill any remaining space in the row after the other two child widgets have been sized.",
            "The Flex widget is used to create a flexible container that can be used to create complex layouts in a Flutter application. The Flex widget provides properties such as direction, mainAxisSize, and mainAxisAlignment, which can be used to control the layout of its children.",

            "The ListView widget is used to display a scrolling list of items in a Flutter application. The ListView widget provides several different types of constructors, such as ListView.builder and ListView.separated, which can be used to customize the behavior of the list.",
            "For example, a developer could use the ListView.builder constructor to create a list of items from a list of data, or use the ListView.separated constructor to add separators between each item in the list.",
            "The GridView widget is used to display a grid of items in a Flutter application. The GridView widget provides several different types of constructors, such as GridView.builder and GridView.count, which can be used to customize the behavior of the grid. For example, a developer could use the GridView.builder constructor to create a grid of items from a list of data, or use the GridView.count constructor to specify the number of columns in the grid.",
            "While both widgets can be used to display similar types of data, there are some key differences between them.",
            "In summary, ListView and GridView are both useful widgets for displaying a list of items, but the choice of which to use depends on the layout and scrolling behavior of the items being displayed. ListView is best suited for displaying a list of items in a single column, while GridView is best suited for displaying items in a grid layout with multiple columns and rows.",
            "A Stream is a sequence of asynchronous events that can be listened to and responded to. Streams provide a way to handle asynchronous data flow, such as data from a network or user input.",
            "Streams in Flutter are based on the Dart Stream API, which provides a set of classes and methods for working with streams. The core concept of the Stream API is that it separates the producer of data from the consumer of data. The producer of data pushes data into the stream, while the consumer of data listens to the stream and responds to events as they are emitted.",
            "In Flutter, streams are commonly used to handle data from sources that emit events over time, such as user input, network responses, or device sensors. Streams are also used to handle animations and other dynamic UI elements that require continuous updates.",
            "The Wrap widget is used to create a layout that wraps its children to the next line when there is not enough space to display them in a single line.",
            "The Wrap widget is useful for creating UIs that need to display a large number of items that cannot fit on a single line. It ensures that the items are displayed in a way that maximizes the available space.",
            "The Stack widget is used to position widgets on top of each other in a Flutter application. The Stack widget provides several properties, such as alignment and overflow, which can be used to control the position and behavior of its children.",
            "For example, a developer could use the alignment property of the Stack widget to position a widget in the center of the screen and use the overflow property to control how the widget is displayed if it is larger than the available space.",
            "The Hero widget is used to create a transition between two widgets that have the same tag in a Flutter application. The Hero widget is useful for creating UIs that need to transition between two screens or two parts of the same screen. It provides a smooth animation that helps the user understand the relationship between the two widgets.",
            "The AnimatedContainer widget is used to animate changes to its properties in a Flutter application. The AnimatedContainer widget provides several properties, such as duration and curve, which can be used to control the animation. For example, a developer could use the AnimatedContainer widget to animate changes to the size or color of a widget in response to user input or other events in the application.",
            "The AnimatedOpacity widget is used to animate changes to the opacity of a widget in a Flutter application. The AnimatedOpacity widget provides properties, such as duration and curve, which can be used to control the animation. For example, a developer could use the AnimatedOpacity widget to animate the appearance or disappearance of a widget in response to user input or other events in the application.",
            "The AnimatedBuilder widget is used to create custom animations in a Flutter application. The AnimatedBuilder widget provides a builder function that can be used to create a custom widget tree that can be animated. For example, a developer could use the AnimatedBuilder widget to create a custom widget tree that animates changes to the position or rotation of a widget in response to user input or other events in the application.",
            "The GestureDetector widget is used to detect gestures, such as taps and swipes, in a Flutter application. The GestureDetector widget provides several callbacks, such as onTap and onVerticalDragUpdate, which can be used to handle different types of gestures. For example, a developer could use the onTap callback of the GestureDetector widget to handle taps on a widget in the application.",
            "The Navigator widget is used to manage a stack of screens, or \u201croutes,\u201d in a Flutter application. The Navigator widget provides several methods, such as push and pop, which can be used to navigate between screens. For example, a developer could use the push method of the Navigator widget to navigate to a new screen in the application, and use the pop method to return to the previous screen.",
            "The MediaQuery.of method is used to retrieve the MediaQueryData object for the nearest ancestor MediaQuery widget in a Flutter application. The MediaQueryData object provides properties, such as devicePixelRatio, orientation, and size, which can be used to create responsive UIs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.",
            "For example, a developer could use the size property of the MediaQueryData object to adjust the font size of a text widget based on the screen size of the device.",
            "The InheritedWidget widget is used to provide data that can be accessed by its descendant widgets in a Flutter application. The InheritedWidget widget provides a mechanism for passing data down the widget tree without having to explicitly pass the data as constructor arguments or method parameters.",

            "A process is an instance of a program in execution. For example, a Web Browser is a process, and a shell (or command prompt) is a process. The operating system is responsible for managing all the processes that are running on a computer and allocates each process a certain amount of time to use the processor. In addition, the operating system also allocates various other resources that processes will need, such as computer memory or disks. To keep track of the state of all the processes, the operating system maintains a table known as the process table. Inside this table, every process is listed along with the resources the process is using and the current state of the process.",
            "Processes can be in one of three states: running, ready, or waiting. The running state means that the process has all the resources it needs for execution and it has been given permission by the operating system to use the processor. Only one process can be in the running state at any given time. The remaining processes are either in a waiting state (i.e., waiting for some external event to occur such as user input or disk access) or a ready state (i.e., waiting for permission to use the processor). In a real operating system, the waiting and ready states are implemented as queues that hold the processes in these states.",
            "A thread is a single sequence stream within a process. Because threads have some of the properties of processes, they are sometimes called lightweight processes. Threads are a popular way to improve the application through parallelism. For example, in a browser, multiple tabs can be different threads. MS Word uses multiple threads, one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs, etc. ",
            "A thread has its own program counter (PC), a register set, and a stack space. Threads are not independent of one another, like processes. As a result, threads share with other threads their code section, data section, and OS resources like open files and signals.",
            "It makes the system more responsive and enables resource sharing. It leads to the use of multiprocess architecture. It is more economical and preferred. ",
            "Thrashing is a situation when the performance of a computer degrades or collapses. Thrashing occurs when a system spends more time processing page faults than executing transactions. While processing page faults is necessary in order to appreciate the benefits of virtual memory, thrashing has a negative effect on the system. As the page fault rate increases, more transactions need processing from the paging device. The queue at the paging device increases, resulting in increased service time for a page fault.",
            "A buffer is a memory area that stores data being transferred between two devices or between a device and an application.",
            "Virtual memory creates an illusion that each user has one or more contiguous address spaces, each beginning at address zero. The sizes of such virtual address spaces are generally very high. The idea of virtual memory is to use disk space to extend the RAM. Running processes don\u2019t need to care whether the memory is from RAM or disk. The illusion of such a large amount of memory is created by subdividing the virtual memory into smaller pieces, which can be loaded into physical memory whenever they are needed by a process. ",

            "Multi-programming increases CPU utilization by organizing jobs (code and data) so that the CPU always has one to execute. The main objective of multi-programming is to keep multiple jobs in the main memory. If one job gets occupied with IO, the CPU can be assigned to other jobs. ",
            "Time-sharing is a logical extension of multiprogramming. The CPU performs many tasks by switches that are so frequent that the user can interact with each program while it is running. A time-shared operating system allows multiple users to share computers simultaneously.",

            "FCFS stands for First Come First served. In the FCFS scheduling algorithm, the job that arrived first in the ready queue is allocated to the CPU and then the job that came second and so on. FCFS is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm as a process that holds the CPU until it either terminates or performs I/O. Thus, if a longer job has been assigned to the CPU then many shorter jobs after it will have to wait.",

            "Paging is a memory management method accustomed fetch processes from the secondary memory into the main memory in the form of pages. in paging, each process is split into parts wherever the size of every part is the same as the page size. The size of the last half could also be but the page size. The pages of the process area unit hold on within the frames of main memory relying upon their accessibility",
            "Swapping is a simple memory/process management technique used by the operating system(os) to increase the utilization of the processor by moving some blocked processes from the main memory to the secondary memory thus forming a queue of the temporarily suspended processes and the execution continues with the newly arrived process. During regular intervals that are set by the operating system, processes can be copied from the main memory to a backing store and then copied back later. Swapping allows more processes to be run that can fit into memory at one time",
            "The direct Access method is based on a disk model of a file, such that it is viewed as a numbered sequence of blocks or records. It allows arbitrary blocks to be read or written. Direct access is advantageous when accessing large amounts of information. Direct memory access (DMA) is a method that allows an input/output (I/O) device to send or receive data directly to or from the main memory, bypassing the CPU to speed up memory operations. The process is managed by a chip known as a DMA controller (DMAC).",
            "Thrashing occurs when processes on the system frequently access pages, not available memory.",
            "The best paging size varies from system to system, so there is no single best when it comes to page size. There are different factors to consider in order to come up with a suitable page size, such as page table, paging time, and its effect on the overall efficiency of the operating system.",
            "Multitasking is a logical extension of a multiprogramming system that supports multiple programs to run concurrently. In multitasking, more than one task is executed at the same time. In this technique, the multiple tasks, also known as processes, share common processing resources such as a CPU.",
            "The cache is a smaller and faster memory that stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory locations. There are various different independent caches in a CPU, which store instructions and data. Cache memory is used to reduce the average time to access data from the Main memory. ",
            "Spooling refers to simultaneous peripheral operations online, spooling refers to putting jobs in a buffer, a special area in memory, or on a disk where a device can access them when it is ready. Spooling is useful because devices access data at different rates.",
            "The Assembler is used to translate the program written in Assembly language into machine code. The source program is an input of an assembler that contains assembly language instructions. The output generated by the assembler is the object code or machine code understandable by the computer.",
            "The interrupts are a signal emitted by hardware or software when a process or an event needs immediate attention. It alerts the processor to a high-priority process requiring interruption of the current working process. In I/O devices one of the bus control lines is dedicated to this purpose and is called the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR). ",

            "These are the methods in IPC:",
            "A process that has finished the execution but still has an entry in the process table to report to its parent process is known as a zombie process. A child process always first becomes a zombie before being removed from the process table. The parent process reads the exit status of the child process which reaps off the child process entry from the process table.",
            "A process whose parent process no more exists i.e. either finished or terminated without waiting for its child process to terminate is called an orphan process.",

            "Aging: Aging is a technique to avoid starvation in a scheduling system. It works by adding an aging factor to the priority of each request. The aging factor must increase the priority of the request as time passes and must ensure that a request will eventually be the highest priority request",

Like microkernel, this one also manages system resources between application and hardware, but user services and kernel services are implemented under the same address space. It increases the size of the kernel, thus increasing the size of an operating system as well. This kernel provides CPU scheduling, memory management, file management, and other operating system functions through system calls. As both services are implemented under the same address space, this makes operating system execution faster.",

            "LLD describes class diagrams with the help of methods and relations between classes and program specs. It describes the modules so that the programmer can directly code the program from the document. It provides us with the structure and behavior of class as different entities have different character sets. From this design, it is easy for a developer to write down logic and henceforth the actual code for it. ",
            "What is Low Level Design or LLD",
            "Class Diagram in LLD: In this diagram we basically list out all the entities which can be part of components. Class diagrams are made as it becomes easier for developer to convert it into code.",
            "For instance: ",
            "Remember: Low-level designing is also known as object-level designing or micro-level or detailed designing. ",
            "As studied, High Level Design or HLD is a general system design where we do tradeoffs between different frameworks, components, and different databases and we choose the best of them. Here we define the components and how these components will be communicating with one another. Hence here we are bothered with generic stuff as follows and not bothered about the code. ",
            "As studied above, input for framing low-level design (LLD) is HLD. Here in LLD, we take care of how our components will look like, the structure possessed by different entities, and how different entities will have their responsibility(operations supported). For this conversion, we use Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams. Adding to these diagrams we use OOPS principles and SOLID principles while designing. Hence, using these 3 paradigm we can convert any HLD to LLD so as to get implemented.",

            "Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. Within polymorphism, we should be clear-cut with compile-time ad run-time polymorphism. Programmers should be absolutely clear about the OOPS concepts to depth right to classes, and objects because OOPS is the foundation on which low-leveling on any system is based. ",
            "Acing low-level design is \u2018extremely subjective\u2019 because we have to optimally use these concepts while coding to build a low-level system via implementing coding software entities(classes, functions, modules, etc)",

And at the same time, there exists a scenario that does not exist in the real world but has to be coded to get solved at low-level designing. For these certain sets of specified problems. There are solutions to these where these problems are already been solved in different complex oriented codes to the problem. Hence the definition is as follows: ",

These problems are been faced and solved by expert designers in the world of programming and the solutions are robust over time saving a lot of time and energy. Hence the complex and classic problems in the software world are being solved by tried and tested solutions. Here we do not look out for solutions that are the so-called design patterns.  ",

            "Physical security is the process of protecting an entity from unauthorized access, use, or destruction. Physical security encompasses a range of measures and technologies used to protect assets from physical harm as well as theft and sabotage. A security building creates controlled pathways so that people entering the building can be identified, and things protected inside the building can be kept secure. The goal of a security building is to create barriers or controlled pathways into this space and ensure that things inside the space remain the various components of physical security that can be collectively used to thwart an intruder. Access control can be used to allow only individuals who are assigned authorization to enter the area and make sure their conduct inside does not violate the rules. Data encryption is used to protect data while it is in transit or while it is stored on the protected system.",

            "Now that we have covered the basics of System Design, it is now time to dive deep into its features and components. One such very important concept in System Design is Scalability.",
            "In system design, Scalability is the capacity of a system to adapt its performance and cost to the new changes in application and system processing demands. ",
            "The architecture used to build services, networks, and processes is scalable under these 2 conditions: ",
            "What is Scalability and How to achieve Scalability \u2013 Learn System Design",
            "Scalability is basically a measure of how well the system will respond to the addition and omission of resources to meet our requirements. That is why we do a Requirement Analysis of the System in the first phase of SDLC and make sure the system is adaptable and scalable. ",
            "Now scalability is achieved via two methods in systems: ",
            "How to achieve Scalability?",
            "Now let us discuss above two methods of scaling up systems as mentioned and showcased above to a greater order degree of depth that is as follows: ",
            "By adding more configuration or hardware for better computing or storage, vertical scaling expands the scale of a system. In actuality, this would include upgrading the processors, raising the RAM, or making other power-increasing changes. Multi-core scaling is used in this case to scale by distributing the load among the CPU and RAM resources. ",
            "Vertical Scaling",
            "Example: MySQL",
            "Through the act of adding new machines, a system can be scaled horizontally. Several devices must be gathered and connected in order to handle more system requests. ",
            "Horizontal Scaling",
            "Examples: Cassandra and MongoDB",
            "Remember: Scalable code is generally computation inefficient. It is bitter truth because we split big and complex code to a set of small associative operations so as to scale up horizontally because vertical scaling has a limit.",
            "Now let us conclude both types of scaling represented below in a tabular format as follows: ",
            "Now that we have looked into the details of each type of scaling, let us compare them with respect to different parameters:",
            "Vertical Scaling vs. Horizontal Scaling",
            "As studied above with the concept of scalability we can while designing the architect of a system we can not opt to design on extreme sides that are either overusing(more number of resources) the resources or underusing (lesser number of resources) the resources per the requirements gathered and analyzed.",
            "Now there is a catch here even if we can design a perpetual perfect system then too there arises a failure(as discussed above in Architect Principle Rules for Designing). Failures do exist for sure as mentioned above in the best-designed system but we can prevent them from hampering our system globally. This is because we keep our system redundant and our data replicated so that it is retained.",
            "Let us now understand these terms in greater depth which are as follows:",
            "Redundancy is nothing more than the duplication of nodes or components so that, in the event of a node or component failure, the backup node can continue to provide services to consumers. In order to sustain availability, failure recovery, or failure management, redundancy is helpful. The goal of redundancy is to create quick, effective, and accessible backup channels.",
            "It is of two types:",
            "What is Redundancy?",
            "Replication is the administration of various data storage in which each component is kept in numerous copies hosted on different servers. It is simply the copying of data between many devices. It involves synchronizing various machines. Replication contributes to increased fault tolerance and reliability by ensuring consistency amongst redundant resources.",
            "Replication",
            "Also, it is of two types:",
            "Now let us, deep dive, into studying concepts of load balancing and hashing from scratch after having pre-requisite knowledge of load balancing and caching.",
            "Tip: Till now we have achieved storing data efficiently by keeping check for efficiently storing data in servers via replication. But if we look carefully till now we only emphasis scaling systems properly but these systems are highly inefficient.",
            "It is because we are only scaling systems keeping in check for node failure arising to Single Point Of Failure in databases (SPOF causes damage to system architect at local and global scale) through redundancy, but not looking out for bounds  as per scaling such as: ",
            "Whenever a system is designed, the following principles should be kept in mind to tackle scalability issues:",
            "In order to make efficient systems scalable from replication parameter where there are multiple copies stored over servers handling SPOF well, here we need to learn 2 concepts listed below that aids us in achieving efficient scalable systems globally even across huge distributed system architect.   ",
            "Now let us cover load balancing to a greater order degree of depth followed by caching to completely understand scalability to higher order degree which is as follows:     ",
            "Load balancing It is a technique of effectively distributing application or network traffic among all nodes in a distributed system. Load balancers are the tools used to ensure load balancing.",
            "How Load balancer works",
            "Let us also make it clear what should be the ideal conditions under which we can use a load balancer. They are as follows: ",
            "Now geeks you must be wondering out are there any pitfalls associated with load balancing.",
            "As we already have discussed a constraint of SPOF while developing systems so the same is incorporated here out. Load balancer failure or breakdown may cause the entire system to be suspended and unavailable for a while, which will negatively affect user experience. Client and server communication would be disrupted in the event of a load balancer malfunction. We can employ redundancy to resolve this problem. Both an active and a passive load balancer may be present in the system. The passive load balancer can take over as the active load balancer if the active load balancer fails.",
            "For better understanding, we will dive to Load Balancing algorithms that are as follows:",
            "For the effective distribution of load over various nodes or servers, various algorithms can be used. Depending on the kind of application the load balancer must be utilized for, the algorithm should be chosen.",
            "A few load-balancing algorithms are listed below:",
            "Now we are done with adequate knowledge of load balancing to dive into caching.",
            "A cache is a portion of data that is generally temporarily cached by a high-speed data storage layer allowing subsequent requests for that data to be fulfilled more quickly than if the data were accessed directly from its original storage location. ",
            "What is Caching?",
            "Caching is a process by which we can reuse data that has already been swiftly accessed or computed by producing a local instance of the static data, caching reduces the number of read calls, API calls, and network I/O calls.",
            "There are basically three types of caches as follows:",
            "The information stored in a cache is typically saved in hardware that provides quick access, such as RAM (random-access memory), but it can also be used by a software component. The main objective is to increase data retrieval performance by avoiding contact with the slower storage layer below.",
            "Note: Applications of caching are: ",
            "Remember: When and where to use caching?",
            "Case1: Static Data: If the data is not changing too regularly, caching would be beneficial. We can save the data and use it right away. Caching wouldn\u2019t do much good if the data was changing quickly.",
            "Case2: Application type: Applications can either be read-intensive or write-intensive. The application that requires a lot of reading would benefit more from caching. Data would change quickly for a write-intensive application, hence caching shouldn\u2019t be used.",
            "Lastly, let us discuss caching strategies to wrap up the concept of caching:",
            " Caching patterns are what designers use to include a cache into a system. Write-through and cache-aside are two common techniques:",
            "The eviction policy of the cache determines the order in which items are removed from a full cache. It\u2019s done to clear some room so that more entries can be added. These policies are listed below as follows:"

            "The Strategy pattern is based on the idea of encapsulating a family of algorithms into separate classes that implement a common interface. The pattern consists of three main components: the Context, the Strategy, and the Concrete Strategy.",
            "The Context is the class that contains the object whose behavior needs to be changed dynamically. The Strategy is the interface or abstract class that defines the common methods for all the algorithms that can be used by the Context object. The Concrete Strategy is the class that implements the Strategy interface and provides the actual implementation of the algorithm.",
            "To use the Strategy pattern, you first create a Context object. Then, you create one or more Concrete Strategy objects that implement the Strategy interface. Finally, you set the Strategy object for the Context object by calling its setStrategy() method. At runtime, the Context object uses the selected Concrete Strategy object to perform its operations.",
            "Overall, the Strategy pattern is a useful design pattern that allows the behavior of an object to be selected dynamically at runtime, providing flexibility, modularity, and testability.",
            "As always we will learn this pattern by defining a problem and using a strategy pattern to solve it. Suppose we are building a game \u201cStreet Fighter\u201d. For simplicity assume that a character may have four moves that is kick, punch, roll, and jump. Every character has kick and punch moves, but roll and jump are optional. How would you model your classes? Suppose initially you use inheritance and abstract out the common features in a Fighter class and let other characters subclass Fighter class.",
            "Fighter class will have a default implementation of normal actions. Any character with specialized move can override that action in its subclass. Class diagram would be as follows:",
            "What are the problems with above design? What if a character doesn\u2019t perform jump move? It still inherits the jump behavior from superclass. Although you can override jump to do nothing in that case but you may have to do so for many existing classes and take care of that for future classes too. This would also make maintenance difficult. So we can\u2019t use inheritance here. ",
            "What about an Interface? Take a look at the following design:  ",
            "It\u2019s much cleaner. We took out some actions (which some characters might not perform) out of Fighterclass and made interfaces for them. That way only characters that are supposed to jump will implement the JumpBehavior.",
            "What are the problems with the above design?",
            "The main problem with the above design is code reuse. Since there is no default implementation of jump and roll behavior we may have code duplicity. You may have to rewrite the same jump behavior over and over in many subclasses.",
            "How can we avoid this?",
            "What if we made JumpBehavior and RollBehavior classes instead of interface? Well then we would have to use multiple inheritance that is not supported in many languages due to many problems associated with it.",

The context would be the class that would require changing behaviors. We can change behavior dynamically.

Perks wide varied in India for Java developers from 300K to 25000K for as fresher based upon the level of intellect.",
            "So, let\u2019s get started with most asked Java Multithreading Interview Questions with their detailed answers.",
            "Q-1 What is multitasking?",
            "A multitasking operating system is an operating system that gives you the perception of 2 or more tasks/jobs/processes running at the same time. It does this by dividing system resources amongst these tasks/jobs/processes and switching between the tasks/jobs/processes while they are executing over and over again. Usually, the CPU processes only one task at a time but the switching is so fast that it looks like the CPU is executing multiple processes at a time. They can support either preemptive multitasking, where the OS provides time to applications (virtually all modern OS), or cooperative multitasking, where the OS waits for the program to give back control (Windows 3.x, Mac OS 9, and earlier), leading to hangs and crashes. Also known as Timesharing, multitasking is a logical extension of multiprogramming.",
            "Multitasking programming is of two types which are as follows:",
            "Note: Performing multiple tasks at one time is referred to as multithreading in java which is of two types namely Process-based multithreading and Thread based multithreading.",
            "Q-2 How can you identify the process?",
            "Any program which is in a working state is referred to as a process. These processes do have threads that are single dispatchable units.",
            "Q-3 How do you see a thread?",
            "In order to see threads status let us take windows as an operating system, it illustrates then we\u2019d have ProcessExplorer where you can see GUI shown below for windows operating systems.",
            "ProcessExplorer is illustrated below in the windows operating systems",
            "Note: All of them as listed in the above media are the processes as shown above where at a time many are running in parallel to each other henceforth illustrating multiprocessing in the Jwindows operating system.  ",
            "As we have seen threads do reside in a single process so we have to deep dive into a specific process to see them in order to show users how multithreading is going on in the computers at the backend. For example: let us pick a random process from the above media consisting of various processes say it be \u2018chrome\u2019. Now we need to right-click over the process and click the properties\u2019 menu.",
            "From the above media, it is clearly perceived that chrome is a process and after proceeding with the steps to figure out threads running inside the chrome process we go to properties of the process \u2018chrome\u2019 below pictorial output will be generated representing threads running in the process chrome.",
            "Note: If we look scroll way from up to down then it will be seeing some colors against a few of those threads. Here green color threads are associated as the newly created threads and red colors associated threads are representing the closed threads.",
            "Note: So for chrome to increase the performance by reducing the response time that is referred to as Thread based multitasking.",
            "Q-4 What is Multithreading and How it is Different from Multitasking?",
            "Multithreading is a specialized form of multitasking. Process-based multitasking refers to executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a separate independent process is Process-based multitasking. ",
            "Example: Running Java IDE and running TextEdit at the same time. Process-based multitasking is represented by the below pictorial which is as follows:",
            "Thread-based multitasking refers to executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a separate independent part of the same program known as a thread. For example, JUnits uses threads to run test cases in parallel. Henceforth, process-based multitasking is a bigger scenario handling process where threads handle the details. It is already discussed to deeper depth already with visual aids.",
            "For more details, please refer to Process-based and Thread-based multitasking in Java ",
            "Q-5 Which Kind of Multitasking is Better and Why?",
            "Thread-based multitasking is better as multitasking of threads requires less overhead as compared to process multitasking because processes are heavyweight in turn requiring their own separate address space in memory while threads being very light-weight processes and share the same address space as cooperatively shared by heavyweight processes.",
            "Switching is a secondary reason as inter-process communication is expensive and limited. Context switching from one process to another is cost hefty whereas inter-thread communication is inexpensive and context switching from one thread to another is lower in cost. ",
            "Note: However java programs make use of process-based multitasking environments, but this feature is not directly under Java\u2019s direct control while multithreading is complete.",
            "Q-6 What is a thread?",
            "Threads are lightweight processes within processes as seen. In java, there are two ways of creating threads namely via Thread class and via Runnable interface.",
            "To read more about this, please refer Thread class in Java, Runnable interface in Java ",
            "Q-7 What are the different states of a thread, or what is thread lifecycle?",
            "A thread in Java at any point of time exists in any one of the following states. A thread lies only in one of the shown states at any instant:",
            "To read more about this, please refer Lifecycle and States of a Thread in Java  ",
            "Q-8 What is the task of the main thread?",
            "All Java programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread which is created by JVM at the program start when the main() method is invoked with the main thread as depicted from the output perceived from pseudo-code illustration.",
            "Illustration:",
            "Q-9 What are the Different Types of threads in Java? ",
            "There are two types of threads in Java as follows:",
            "User threads are created by java developers for example Main thread. All threads are created inside the main() method are by default non-daemon thread because the \u2018main\u2019 thread is non-daemon. Daemon thread is a low-priority thread that runs in the background to perform tasks such as garbage collection, etc. They do not prevent daemon threads from exiting when all user threads finish their execution. JVM terminates itself when all non-daemon threads finish their execution. JVM does not care whether a thread is running or not, if JVM finds a running daemon thread it terminates the thread and after that shutdown itself.",
            "Q-10 How to Create a User thread?",
            "As discussed earlier when the JVM starts it creates a main thread over which the program is run unless an additional thread is not created by the user. The first thing \u201cMain\u201d thread looks for \u2018public static void main(String [] args)\u2019 method to invoke it as it acts as an entry point to the program. All other threads created in main acts as child threads of the \u201cMain\u201d thread. ",
            "User thread can be implemented in two ways listed below:",
            "Q-11 How to set the name of the thread?",
            "We can name a thread by using a method been already up there known as setName() replacing default naming which was \u2018Thread-0\u2019, \u2018Thread-1\u2019, and so on.",
            "Q-12 What is thread priority?",
            "Priorities in threads is a concept where each thread is having a priority which in layman\u2019s language one can say every object is having priority here which is represented by numbers ranging from 1 to 10. ",
            "Here 3 constants are defined in it namely as follows:",
            "To read more about this, please refer Thread Priority in Multithreading in Java ",
            "Q-13 How deadlock plays a important role in multithreading?",
            "If we do incorporate threads in operating systems one can perceive that the process scheduling algorithms in operating systems are strongly deep-down working on the same concept incorporating thread in Gantt charts. A few of the most popular are listed below which wraps up all of them and are used practically in software development.",
            "Now one Imagine the concept of Deadlock in operating systems with threads by now how the switching is getting computed over internally if one only has an overview of them. ",
            "Q-14 Why output is not ordered? ",
            "Scheduling of threads involves two boundary scheduling,",
            "If multiple threads are waiting to execute then thread execution is decided by \u201cThreadScheduler\u201d which is a part of JVM hence its vendor dependent resulting in unexpected execution of output order.",
            "Note: ",
            "It is as illustrated in the below illustration which is as follows:",
            "Q-15 What is Daemon Thread in Java and explain their properties? ",
            "Daemon thread is a low-priority thread that runs in the background to perform tasks such as garbage collection. It does possess certain specific properties as listed below:",
            "Note: The main difference between user thread and daemon thread is that JVM does not wait for daemon thread  before exiting while it do waits for the user thread.",
            "To read more about this, please refer to Daemon Thread in Java ",
            "Q-16 How to Make User Thread to Daemon Thread?",
            "It is carried out with the help of two methods listed in \u2018Thread class\u2019 known as setDaemon() and isDaemon(). First, the setDaemon() method converts user thread to daemon thread and vice-versa. This method can only be called before starting the thread using start() method else is called after starting the thread with will throw IllegalThreadStateException After this, isDaemon() method is used which returns a boolean true if the thread is daemon else returns false if it is a non-daemon thread.  ",
            "Q-17 What are the tasks of the start() method?",
            "The primary task of the start() method is to register the thread with the thread scheduler, so one can tell what child thread should perform, when, and how it will be scheduled that is handled by the thread scheduler. The secondary task is to call the corresponding run() method got the threads.",
            "Q-18 What is the difference between the start() and run() method?",
            "First, both methods are operated in general over the thread. So if we do use threadT1.start() then this method will look for the run() method to create a new thread. While in case of theadT1.run() method will be executed just likely the normal method by the \u201cMain\u201d thread without the creation of any new thread.",
            "Note: If we do replace start() method with run() method then the entire program is carried by \u2018main\u2019 thread.",
            "Q-19 Can we Overload run() method? What if we do not override the run() method? ",
            "Yes, it is possible to overload run() by passing parameters to it and also keeping a check over to comment down @override from the run() method. ",
            "It should be as good as a thread wherein thread we do not have any arguments, so practice to overload is to comment on the call out for overloaded run() method. Now, so we need to acknowledge the same whether the output is the same or not if we have not overloaded it. ",

            "Hashing refers to the process of generating a fixed-size output from an input of variable size using the mathematical formulas known as hash functions. This technique determines an index or location for the storage of an item in a data structure.",
            "What is Hashing",
            "Table of Contents/Roadmap",
            "Every day, the data on the internet is increasing multifold and it is always a struggle to store this data efficiently. In day-to-day programming, this amount of data might not be that big, but still, it needs to be stored, accessed, and processed easily and efficiently. A very common data structure that is used for such a purpose is the Array data structure.",
            "Now the question arises if Array was already there, what was the need for a new data structure! The answer to this is in the word \u201cefficiency\u201c. Though storing in Array takes O(1) time, searching in it takes at least O(log n) time. This time appears to be small, but for a large data set, it can cause a lot of problems and this, in turn, makes the Array data structure inefficient. ",
            "So now we are looking for a data structure that can store the data and search in it in constant time, i.e. in O(1) time. This is how Hashing data structure came into play. With the introduction of the Hash data structure, it is now possible to easily store data in constant time and retrieve them in constant time as well.",
            "There are majorly three components of hashing:",
            "Components of Hashing",
            "Suppose we have a set of strings {\u201cab\u201d, \u201ccd\u201d, \u201cefg\u201d} and we would like to store it in a table. ",
            "Our main objective here is to search or update the values stored in the table quickly in O(1) time and we are not concerned about the ordering of strings in the table. So the given set of strings can act as a key and the string itself will act as the value of the string but how to store the value corresponding to the key? ",
            "Mapping key with indices of array",
            "The above technique enables us to calculate the location of a given string by using a simple hash function and rapidly find the value that is stored in that location. Therefore the idea of hashing seems like a great way to store (key, value) pairs of the data in a table.",
            "The hash function creates a mapping between key and value, this is done through the use of mathematical formulas known as hash functions. The result of the hash function is referred to as a hash value or hash. The hash value is a representation of the original string of characters but usually smaller than the original.",
            "For example: Consider an array as a Map where the key is the index and the value is the value at that index. So for an array A if we have index i which will be treated as the key then we can find the value by simply looking at the value at A[i].simply looking up A[i]. ",
            "There are many hash functions that use numeric or alphanumeric keys. This article focuses on discussing different hash functions:",
            "A hash function that maps every item into its own unique slot is known as a perfect hash function. We can construct a perfect hash function if we know the items and the collection will never change but the problem is that there is no systematic way to construct a perfect hash function given an arbitrary collection of items. Fortunately, we will still gain performance efficiency even if the hash function isn\u2019t perfect. We can achieve a perfect hash function by increasing the size of the hash table so that every possible value can be accommodated. As a result, each item will have a unique slot. Although this approach is feasible for a small number of items, it is not practical when the number of possibilities is large.",
            "So, We can construct our hash function to do the same but the things that we must be careful about while constructing our own hash function.",
            "A\u202fgood hash function\u202fshould have the following properties:",
            "If we consider the above example, the hash function we used is the sum of the letters, but if we examined the hash function closely then the problem can be easily visualized that for different strings same hash value is begin generated by the hash function. ",
            "For example: {\u201cab\u201d, \u201cba\u201d} both have the same hash value, and string {\u201ccd\u201d,\u201dbe\u201d} also generate the same hash value, etc. This is known as collision and it creates problem in searching, insertion, deletion, and updating of value. ",
            "The hashing process generates a small number for a big key, so there is a possibility that two keys could produce the same value. The situation where the newly inserted key maps to an already occupied, and it must be handled using some collision handling technology.",
            "What is Collision in Hashing",
            "There are mainly two methods to handle collision: ",
            "Collision resolution technique",
            "The idea is to make each cell of the hash table point to a linked list of records that have the same hash function value. Chaining is simple but requires additional memory outside the table.",
            "Example: We have given a hash function and we have to insert some elements in the hash table using a separate chaining method for collision resolution technique.",

            "Hence In this way, the separate chaining method is used as the collision resolution technique.",
            "In open addressing, all elements are stored in the hash table itself. Each table entry contains either a record or NIL. When searching for an element, we examine the table slots one by one until the desired element is found or it is clear that the element is not in the table.",
            "In linear probing, the hash table is searched sequentially that starts from the original location of the hash. If in case the location that we get is already occupied, then we check for the next location. ",
            "Algorithm:",

            "This method is also known as the mid-square method because in this method we look for i2\u2018th probe (slot) in i\u2019th iteration and the value of i = 0, 1, . . . n \u2013 1. We always start from the original hash location. If only the location is occupied then we check the other slots.",

            "Insert key 72 in the hash table",
            "The load factor of the hash table can be defined as the number of items the hash table contains divided by the size of the hash table. Load factor is the decisive parameter that is used when we want to rehash the previous hash function or want to add more elements to the existing hash table.",
            "It helps us in determining the efficiency of the hash function i.e. it tells whether the hash function which we are using is distributing the keys uniformly or not in the hash table.",
            "As the name suggests, rehashing means hashing again. Basically, when the load factor increases to more than its predefined value (the default value of the load factor is 0.75), the complexity increases. So to overcome this, the size of the array is increased (doubled) and all the values are hashed again and stored in the new double-sized array to maintain a low load factor and low complexity.",
            "From the above discussion, we conclude that the goal of hashing is to resolve the challenge of finding an item quickly in a collection. For example, if we have a list of millions of English words and we wish to find a particular term then we would use hashing to locate and find it more efficiently. It would be inefficient to check each item on the millions of lists until we find a match. Hashing reduces search time by restricting the search to a smaller set of words at the beginning."

Formally it is defined as below: The iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation.

The ConcreteAggregate implements createIterator() that returns iterator for its collection. Each ConcreteAggregate\u2019s responsibility is to instantiate a ConcreteIterator that can iterate over its collection of objects. The iterator interface provides a set of methods for traversing or modifying the collection that is in addition to next()/hasNext() it can also provide functions for search, remove etc. Let\u2019s understand this through an example. Suppose we are creating a notification bar in our application that displays all the notifications which are held in a notification collection. NotificationCollection provides an iterator to iterate over its elements without exposing how it has implemented the collection (array in this case) to the Client (NotificationBar).   The class diagram would be:  Below is the Java implementation of the same: ",

            "What is Recursion? The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc. A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems. Many more recursive calls can be generated as and when required. It is essential to know that we should provide a certain case in order to terminate this recursion process. So we can say that every time the function calls itself with a simpler version of the original problem.",

            "Recursion is an amazing technique with the help of which we can reduce the length of our code and make it easier to read and write. It has certain advantages over the iteration technique which will be discussed later. A task that can be defined with its similar subtask, recursion is one of the best solutions for it. For example; The Factorial of a number.",

            "A Mathematical Interpretation",
            "Let us consider a problem that a programmer has to determine the sum of first n natural numbers, there are several ways of doing that but the simplest approach is simply to add the numbers starting from 1 to n. So the function simply looks like this,",

            "f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 +\u2026\u2026..+ n",

            "f(n) = n + f(n-1)    n>1",
            "There is a simple difference between the approach (1) and approach(2) and that is in approach(2) the function \u201c f( ) \u201d itself is being called inside the function, so this phenomenon is named recursion, and the function containing recursion is called recursive function, at the end, this is a great tool in the hand of the programmers to code some problems in a lot easier and efficient way.",
            "How are recursive functions stored in memory?",
            "Recursion uses more memory, because the recursive function adds to the stack with each recursive call, and keeps the values there until the call is finished. The recursive function uses LIFO (LAST IN FIRST OUT) Structure just like the stack data structure. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/ ",
            "What is the base condition in recursion? In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution to the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.  ",
            "In the above example, the base case for n < = 1 is defined and the larger value of a number can be solved by converting to a smaller one till the base case is reached.",
            "How a particular problem is solved using recursion? The idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems, and add one or more base conditions that stop the recursion. For example, we compute factorial n if we know the factorial of (n-1). The base case for factorial would be n = 0. We return 1 when n = 0. ",

            "If fact(10) is called, it will call fact(9), fact(8), fact(7), and so on but the number will never reach 100. So, the base case is not reached. If the memory is exhausted by these functions on the stack, it will cause a stack overflow error. ",
            "What is the difference between direct and indirect recursion? A function fun is called direct recursive if it calls the same function fun. A function fun is called indirect recursive if it calls another function say fun_new and fun_new calls fun directly or indirectly. The difference between direct and indirect recursion has been illustrated in Table 1. ",
            "What is the difference between tailed and non-tailed recursion? A recursive function is tail recursive when a recursive call is the last thing executed by the function. Please refer tail recursion article for details. ",
            "How memory is allocated to different function calls in recursion? When any function is called from main(), the memory is allocated to it on the stack. A recursive function calls itself, the memory for a called function is allocated on top of memory allocated to the calling function and a different copy of local variables is created for each function call. When the base case is reached, the function returns its value to the function by whom it is called and memory is de-allocated and the process continues.Let us take the example of how recursion works by taking a simple function. ",

In statement 2, printFun(2) is called and memory is allocated to printFun(2) and a local variable test is initialized to 2 and statement 1 to 4 are pushed into the stack. Similarly, printFun(2) calls printFun(1) and printFun(1) calls printFun(0). printFun(0) goes to if statement and it return to printFun(1). The remaining statements of printFun(1) are executed and it returns to printFun(2) and so on. In the output, values from 3 to 1 are printed and then 1 to 3 are printed.

            "It\u2019s important to note that recursion can be inefficient and lead to stack overflows if not used carefully. Each function call adds a new frame to the call stack, which can cause the stack to grow too large if the recursion is too deep. In addition, recursion can make the code more difficult to understand and debug, since it requires thinking about multiple levels of function calls.",
            "However, recursion can also be a powerful tool for solving complex problems, particularly those that involve breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems. When used correctly, recursion can make the code more elegant and easier to read.",
            "What are the disadvantages of recursive programming over iterative programming? Note that both recursive and iterative programs have the same problem-solving powers, i.e., every recursive program can be written iteratively and vice versa is also true. The recursive program has greater space requirements than the iterative program as all functions will remain in the stack until the base case is reached. It also has greater time requirements because of function calls and returns overhead.",
            "Moreover, due to the smaller length of code, the codes are difficult to understand and hence extra care has to be practiced while writing the code. The computer may run out of memory if the recursive calls are not properly checked.",
            "What are the advantages of recursive programming over iterative programming? Recursion provides a clean and simple way to write code. Some problems are inherently recursive like tree traversals, Tower of Hanoi, etc. For such problems, it is preferred to write recursive code. We can write such codes also iteratively with the help of a stack data structure. For example refer Inorder Tree Traversal without Recursion, Iterative Tower of Hanoi.",

            "This pattern is easy to understand as the real world is full of adapters.   For example consider a USB to Ethernet adapter. We need this when we have an Ethernet interface on one end and USB on the other. Since they are incompatible with each other. we use an adapter that converts one to other. This example is pretty analogous to Object Oriented Adapters. In design, adapters are used when we have a class (Client) expecting some type of object and we have an object (Adaptee) offering the same features but exposing a different interface.",
            "To use an adapter:",

Adapter lets classes work together that couldn\u2019t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Class Diagram:  The client sees only the target interface and not the adapter. The adapter implements the target interface. Adapter delegates all requests to Adaptee. Example:",

Let\u2019s assume that you are short on ToyDuck objects and you would like to use Bird objects in their place. Birds have some similar functionality but implement a different interface, so we can\u2019t use them directly. So we will use adapter pattern. Here our client would be ToyDuck and adaptee would be Bird.",

            "Explanation : Suppose we have a bird that can makeSound(), and we have a plastic toy duck that can squeak(). Now suppose our client changes the requirement and he wants the toyDuck to makeSound than ? Simple solution is that we will just change the implementation class to the new adapter class and tell the client to pass the instance of the bird(which wants to squeak()) to that class. Before : ToyDuck toyDuck = new PlasticToyDuck(); After : ToyDuck toyDuck = new BirdAdapter(sparrow); You can see that by changing just one line the toyDuck can now do Chirp Chirp !! Object Adapter Vs Class Adapter The adapter pattern we have implemented above is called Object Adapter Pattern because the adapter holds an instance of adaptee. There is also another type called Class Adapter Pattern which use inheritance instead of composition but you require multiple inheritance to implement it. Class diagram of Class Adapter Pattern:  Here instead of having an adaptee object inside adapter (composition) to make use of its functionality adapter inherits the adaptee. Since multiple inheritance is not supported by many languages including java and is associated with many problems we have not shown implementation using class adapter pattern. Advantages:",

            "Pattern designing refers to the process of creating a blueprint or template for a garment or textile item. Pattern designing involves a combination of artistic creativity and technical skill, and it plays an essential role in the fashion industry and other related fields. In order to create a pattern, a designer typically begins with a sketch or a series of sketches, which serve as a visual representation of the design concept. The designer then translates the sketch into a 2D pattern, taking into account the various components of the garment, such as sleeves, collars, and cuffs. The pattern must be precise and accurate to ensure that the finished garment fits well and looks good.",
            "Note: Pattern is usually made out of paper or cardboard and serves as a guide for cutting and sewing fabric pieces to create the final product",
            "There are several methods for creating a pattern, including draping, flat patternmaking, and computer-aided design (CAD). Draping involves creating the pattern directly on a mannequin or dress form, while flat patternmaking involves drawing the pattern pieces onto paper using measurements and calculations. CAD uses specialized software to create digital patterns that can be edited and adjusted easily.",
            "Once the pattern is complete, it can be used to create a sample garment, which is then tested for fit and functionality. Adjustments may be made to the pattern based on the results of the fitting, and the process may be repeated until the desired result is achieved.",
            "Pattern designing requires a combination of skills, including creativity, attention to detail, and technical knowledge. A successful pattern designer must be able to visualize the finished product and translate that vision into a precise and accurate pattern.",
            "A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems that occur in software design. The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects. The idea is to speed up the development process by providing well-tested, proven development/design paradigms. Design patterns are programming language-independent strategies for solving a common problem. That means a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation. By using design patterns, you can make your code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.",
            "It\u2019s not mandatory to always implement design patterns in your project. Design patterns are not meant for project development. Design patterns are meant for common problem-solving. Whenever there is a need, you have to implement a suitable pattern to avoid such problems in the future. To find out which pattern to use, you just have to try to understand the design patterns and their purposes. Only by doing that, you will be able to pick the right one. ",
            "Goal: Understand the purpose and usage of each design pattern in order to pick and implement the correct pattern as needed. ",
            "Example:",
            "In many real-world situations, we want to create only one instance of a class. For example, there can be only one active president of a country at any given time. This pattern is called a Singleton pattern. Other software examples could be a single DB connection shared by multiple objects as creating a separate DB connection for every object is costly. Similarly, there can be a single configuration manager or error manager in an application that handles all problems instead of creating multiple managers. ",
            "There are mainly three types of design patterns: ",
            "1. Creational Design Pattern",
            "These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done. ",
            "Creational design patterns are the Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Object Pool, and Prototype. ",
            "Use case of creational design pattern- 1) Suppose a developer wants to create a simple DBConnection class to connect to a database and wants to access the database at multiple locations from code, generally what the developer will do is create an instance of DBConnection class and use it for doing database operations wherever required. This results in creating multiple connections from the database as each instance of DBConnection class will have a separate connection to the database. In order to deal with it, we create DBConnection class as a singleton class, so that only one instance of DBConnection is created and a single connection is established. Because we can manage DB Connection via one instance, we can control load balance, unnecessary connections, etc. ",
            "2) Suppose you want to create multiple instances of a similar kind and want to achieve loose coupling then you can go for Factory pattern. A class implementing a factory design pattern works as a bridge between multiple classes. Consider an example of using multiple database servers like SQL Server and Oracle. If you are developing an application using SQL Server database as the back end, but in the future need to change the database to oracle, you will need to modify all your code so that factory design patterns maintain loose coupling and easy implementation, we should go for the factory design pattern in order to achieve loose coupling and the creation of a similar kind of object.",
            "2. Structural Design Pattern",
            "These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. Structural design patterns are Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data, and Proxy. ",
            "Use Case Of Structural Design Pattern- ",
            "1) When 2 interfaces are not compatible with each other and want to establish a relationship between them through an adapter it\u2019s called an adapter design pattern. The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface or class that the client expects, i.e adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatibility. so in these types of incompatible scenarios, we can go for the adapter pattern.",
            "3. Behavioral Design Pattern",
            "Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns. Behavioral patterns are Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, Observer, State, Strategy, Template method, Visitor ",
            "Use Case of Behavioral Design Pattern- ",
            "1) The template pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation deferring some steps to sub-classes. The template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm structure. For example, in your project, you want the behavior of the module to be able to extend, such that we can make the module behave in new and different ways as the requirements of the application change, or to meet the needs of new applications. However, no one is allowed to make source code changes to it, i.e you can add but can\u2019t modify the structure in those scenarios a developer can approach template design patterns.",

It is one of the old and most popular programming languages. There are many applications in which C programming language is used, including language compilers, operating systems, assemblers, network drivers, text editors, print spoolers, modern applications, language interpreters, databases, and utilities. ",

It is both an assembly-level language, i.e. a low-level language, and a higher-level language. Programs that are written in C are converted into assembly code, and they support pointer arithmetic (low-level) while being machine-independent (high-level). Therefore, C is often referred to as a middle-level language. C can be used to write operating systems and menu-driven consumer billing systems.",

When it comes to storing and searching large amounts of data, traditional binary search trees can become impractical due to their poor performance and high memory usage. B-Trees, also known as B-Tree or Balanced Tree, are a type of self-balancing tree that was specifically designed to overcome these limitations.",

Each node in a B-Tree can contain multiple keys, which allows the tree to have a larger branching factor and thus a shallower height. This shallow height leads to less disk I/O, which results in faster search and insertion operations. B-Trees are particularly well suited for storage systems that have slow, bulky data access such as hard drives, flash memory, and CD-ROMs.",

This balance guarantees that the time complexity for operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching is always O(log n), regardless of the initial shape of the tree.",

            "Traversal is also similar to Inorder traversal of Binary Tree. We start from the leftmost child, recursively print the leftmost child, then repeat the same process for the remaining children and keys. In the end, recursively print the rightmost child. ",
            "Search is similar to the search in Binary Search Tree. Let the key to be searched is k. ",
            "Searching a B-Tree is similar to searching a binary tree. The algorithm is similar and goes with recursion. At each level, the search is optimized as if the key value is not present in the range of the parent then the key is present in another branch. As these values limit the search they are also known as limiting values or separation values. If we reach a leaf node and don\u2019t find the desired key then it will display NULL.",
            "Examples: ",
            "Input: Search 120 in the given B-Tree.  ",

            " ",
            "In this example, we can see that our search was reduced by just limiting the chances where the key containing the value could be present. Similarly if within the above example we\u2019ve to look for 180, then the control will stop at step 2 because the program will find that the key 180 is present within the current node. And similarly, if it\u2019s to seek out 90 then as 90 < 100 so it\u2019ll go to the left subtree automatically, and therefore the control flow will go similarly as shown within the above example.",

            "So what we want to achieve is a design that provides loose coupling and remote control should not have much information about a particular device. The command pattern helps us do that.",
            "Definition: The command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting us parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.",
            "The definition is a bit confusing at first but let\u2019s step through it. In analogy to our problem above remote control is the client and stereo, lights, etc. are the receivers. In a command pattern, there is a Command object that encapsulates a request by binding together a set of actions on a specific receiver. It does so by exposing just one method execute() that causes some actions to be invoked on the receiver.",

The Command may have an added unExecute operation that reverses the effects of a previous call to execute.It may also support logging changes so that they can be reapplied in case of a system crash.",

Thus the decision is made at run time. This is referred to as dynamic method dispatch.",

ArrayList elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations in order to accommodate this dynamic nature. Instead, the ArrayList makes use of a method known as an expandable array in which the underlying array is expanded to a larger size as needed and the elements are then copied to the new location.

In contrast to running the same program on a computer with multiple CPUs or cores, multi-threading on a single CPU can only give the appearance of parallelism, and actual performance gains may be modest.

There are situations in which garbage collector does not collect objects because there is a reference to those objects. In these situations where the application creates lots of objects and does not use them and every object has some valid references, a Garbage collector in Java cannot destroy the objects. These useless objects which do not provide any value to the program are known as Memory leaks. Memory leaks can impact garbage collection negatively by preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming unused memory. This behavior will lead to slow performance or sometimes system failure.

While dynamic programming can use recursion techniques, recursion itself doesn\u2019t have anything similar to dynamic programming. . Dynamic programming involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant computation, and using these solutions to construct the overall solution. Recursion, on the other hand, is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively.",
            "Dynamic Programming (DP) is a technique that solves some particular type of problems in Polynomial Time. Dynamic Programming solutions are faster than the exponential brute method and can be easily proved their correctness. Dynamic programming works by breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and using the solutions to these subproblems to construct the overall solution. The solutions to the subproblems are stored in a table or array (memoization) or in a bottom-up manner (tabulation) to avoid redundant computation.",
            "Greedy Algorithms are similar to dynamic programming in the sense that they are both tools for optimization. Both dynamic programming and greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. However, while dynamic programming breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and solves them independently, greedy algorithms make a locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a globally optimal solution.",
            "You can solve subproblems faster by using dynamic programming, which is nothing more than recursion and memoization, thereby reducing the complexity of your code and making it faster. Following are the basic points:",

Additionally, practical experience can be exploited to benefit from dynamic programming\u2019s better efficiency. However, there isn\u2019t a single, accepted paradigm for dynamic programming, and other conditions could show up as the problem is being solved. Dynamic programming algorithms are guaranteed to find the optimal solution among a set of possible solutions, provided that the problem satisfies the principle of optimality. The solutions to subproblems can be stored in a table, which can be reused for similar problems. Dynamic programming can be applied to a wide range of problems, including optimization, sequence alignment, and resource allocation.",
            "In conclusion, dynamic programming is a powerful problem-solving technique that is used for optimization problems. Dynamic programming is a superior form of recursion that overcomes its limitations. It involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and using the solutions to these subproblems to construct the overall solution. The key characteristics of a dynamic programming algorithm include overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure, memoization or tabulation, and the use of either iterative or recursive methods.",
            "Dynamic programming has several advantages over other problem-solving techniques, including efficiency, simplicity, flexibility, optimality, clarity, and code reusability. It is not just recursion, although it can be implemented using a recursive algorithm. Dynamic programming is different from greedy algorithms in that it breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem independently, and uses the solutions to the subproblems to construct the overall solution.",
            "The basics of dynamic programming include breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, storing the solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant computation, using the solutions to the subproblems to construct the overall solution and using the principle of optimality to ensure that the solution is optimal.  However, DP can occasionally be challenging to comprehend, making it a well-liked option for coding interviews. Understanding how DP functions work can be useful to everyone, whether they are a professional or a student getting ready for the placements. ",
